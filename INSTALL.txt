INSTALL & USE:

Prerequisites: Maven 2.x+, JDK 1.5+, MySQL (If you want to enable the Workspace feature)

* Building with the Workspace feature enabled

1) Create an 'xwiki' user on MySQL, grant him all privileges and create an xwiki database (this is required for enabling the Workspace feature!)
1.1) mysql -u root -p -e "grant all privileges on *.* to xwiki@127.0.0.1 identified by 'xwiki'"
1.2) mysql -u root -p -e "create database xwiki"

2) Build the Wiki30 distribution
2.1) mvn clean install -Pmysql (this is required for enabling the Workspace feature!)
2.2) Unpack the wiki30-distribution/wiki30-distribution-zip/target/wiki30-distribution-zip-1.0-SNAPSHOT.zip
2.3) Start XWiki using the start_xwiki.sh (start_xwiki.bat) script

* Building with the Workspace feature disabled

1) No MySQL required
2.1) mvn clean install
2.2) Unpack the wiki30-distribution/wiki30-distribution-zip/target/wiki30-distribution-zip-1.0-SNAPSHOT.zip
2.3) Start XWiki using the start_xwiki.sh (start_xwiki.bat) script

3) Import the wiki30-distribution-xar.xar file located in wiki30-distribution/wiki30-distribution-xar/target directory
3.1) Do it from http://localhost:8080/xwiki/bin/import/XWiki/XWikiPreferences?editor=globaladmin&section=Import
3.2) Select the file wiki30-distribution-xar.xar file located in wiki30-distribution/wiki30-distribution-xar/target then click "Upload". 
3.3) After successful uploading, you'll see the imported package in the "Available packages" section on same page.
3.4) Select the imported file. The archive's content will be displayed in the upper right part.
3.5) Accept default settings then click on the "Import" button. You should see an information message like: "Import successful"

4) Go to http://localhost:8080 and login as "Admin/admin" to complete the installation.

5) To edit a document/page using real-time editor, select the option "Real Time" located in the "Edit" menu.
Lets say you create a new "TestPage" in "Sandbox" space then click on "Edit" and select "Real Time" option.
Thus the url of the page would be: http://localhost:8080/xwiki/bin/edit/Sandbox/TestPage?&editor=rt.

6) To collaboratively edit the same page in real-time, point 2 browser instances with the "Real Time" edit mode to the same wiki page.
In the second browser for instance use the same url (http://localhost:8080/xwiki/bin/edit/Sandbox/TestPage?&editor=rt)
then click the "Join editing session" and start typing. You should see the changes reflected in the other browser.
